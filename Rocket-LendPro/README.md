  dashboardMetrics: DashboardMetrics! @authorize(roles: ["Admin"])
  users(first: Int): UserConnection! @authorize(roles: ["Admin"])
  loanApplications(first: Int): LoanApplicationConnection! @authorize(roles: ["Admin"])
}

type Mutation {
  # Authentication
  login(email: String!, password: String!): LoginResult!
  register(input: RegisterInput!): RegisterResult!
  
  # Property operations
  toggleFavoriteProperty(propertyId: Int!): ToggleFavoriteResult! @authorize
  
  # Loan operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Apollo Client Invariant Violation (Error 18)
**Symptoms**: Console error "Invariant Violation" when accessing authenticated pages
**Solution**: 
- Check that your components wait for session to be established
- Use `skip: !session?.accessToken` in useQuery hooks
- Ensure services return empty arrays instead of throwing on auth errors

#### Property Price Not Auto-Populating
**Symptoms**: Mortgage calculator doesn't show property price when navigating from property details
**Solution**:
- Verify the property details page passes `propertyPrice` as URL parameter
- Check that mortgage-tools page reads `searchParams.get('propertyPrice')`
- Ensure form default values use the URL parameter

#### Favorites Not Updating
**Symptoms**: Favorite heart icon doesn't update immediately
**Solution**:
- Check that `toggleFavoriteProperty` mutation includes proper cache updates
- Verify optimistic responses are configured
- Ensure `isFavorite` field is included in all property queries

#### Authentication Errors
**Symptoms**: 401 errors or unexpected logouts
**Solution**:
- Verify NextAuth is properly configured
- Check that Apollo Client uses session tokens, not localStorage
- Ensure JWT token expiration matches between frontend and backend

#### React Controlled/Uncontrolled Input Errors
**Symptoms**: Console warning "A component is changing an uncontrolled input to be controlled"
**Solution**:
- Initialize all form fields with default values (empty strings, not undefined)
- Pay special attention to conditional fields (like previousAddress in loan application)
- Ensure all field paths in defaultValues match the schema exactly

#### Loan Application 404 Error
**Symptoms**: POST http://localhost:5001/api/loans returns 404
**Solution**:
- Backend is GraphQL-only, no REST endpoints exist
- Use GraphQL mutations for all data operations
- Create service layer that transforms complex form data to GraphQL mutations
- Import loan service from `@/lib/graphql/services/loan.service`

#### GraphQL Connection Type Errors
**Symptoms**: "The field `id` does not exist on the type `MyLoanApplicationsConnection`"
**Solution**:
- Queries with `[UsePaging]` attribute return connection types with edges/nodes
- Access fields through: `data.myLoanApplications.edges.map(edge => edge.node)`
- Update all paginated queries to use connection pattern
- Check backend Query.cs for `[UsePaging]` attributes to identify connection types

### Port Conflicts
The startup script automatically cleans ports 3000 and 5001. If issues persist:
```bash
# Kill processes manually
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
lsof -ti:5001 | xargs kill -9
```

### GraphQL Schema Issues
Visit http://localhost:5001/graphql to explore the GraphQL schema and test queries in the playground.

### Apollo Client Cache Issues
Clear Apollo Client cache by restarting the frontend development server or using:
```javascript
// In browser console
window.__APOLLO_CLIENT__.cache.reset()
```

### Log Files
- Backend: `logs/backend.log`
- Frontend: `logs/frontend.log`
- Installation: `frontend-install.log`

## Deployment

Both frontend and backend are containerization-ready with proper health checks and environment configuration support.

### Production Considerations
- Update environment variables for production URLs
- Configure proper database connections
- Set secure JWT secrets
- Enable HTTPS
- Configure reverse proxy (nginx/Apache)

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Best Practices
1. **Session Management**: Always check authentication status before making authenticated API calls
2. **Error Handling**: Implement graceful fallbacks instead of throwing errors in services
3. **Data Flow**: Use URL parameters for passing data between pages for better UX
