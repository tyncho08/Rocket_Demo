## Comparative Analysis

### Total Lines of Code
- **Rocket-LendPro**: 15,551 lines
- **MergedApp-LendPro**: 29,989 lines
- **Difference**: MergedApp-LendPro has 93% more code (14,438 additional lines)

### Backend Comparison
- **Rocket-LendPro**: 2,686 lines (GraphQL API)
- **MergedApp-LendPro**: 1,744 lines (REST API)
- **Difference**: Rocket-LendPro backend is 54% larger (942 additional lines)

### Frontend Comparison
- **Rocket-LendPro**: 12,684 lines (Next.js)
- **MergedApp-LendPro**: 28,064 lines (Angular)
- **Difference**: MergedApp-LendPro frontend is 121% larger (15,380 additional lines)

### Key Observations

1. **Frontend Architecture**: The Angular application (MergedApp) has significantly more frontend code, which is typical due to:
   - More verbose TypeScript class-based components
   - Separate HTML template files
   - Extensive unit test files (spec.ts)
   - More boilerplate code required by Angular

2. **Backend Architecture**: Rocket-LendPro's backend is larger despite being newer, likely due to:
   - GraphQL implementation requiring more type definitions
   - More comprehensive service implementations
   - Additional GraphQL-specific code (types, queries, mutations)

3. **Code Organization**: Both projects share the same database schema (181 lines), indicating similar data models

4. **Testing**: MergedApp-LendPro includes extensive test files (.spec.ts), contributing significantly to its larger codebase

## Conclusion

While MergedApp-LendPro has nearly twice the total lines of code, this doesn't necessarily indicate more functionality. The difference is largely attributed to:
- Angular's more verbose coding patterns compared to Next.js
- Extensive unit test coverage in the Angular application
- Different architectural approaches (REST vs GraphQL)

Rocket-LendPro demonstrates a more concise, modern approach with its Next.js + GraphQL stack, achieving similar functionality with significantly less code.
